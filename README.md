 **DAY 6,7:**
By the end of #week1ofmlcode in 100 days of ml coding challenge,  I thought of taking up a course on Coursera -"Introduction to Data Science in Python" which would help me to emulate the best and I successfully completed the course which helped me in understanding data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library.

**DAY 17:**
TOPIC: Probability
UNDERSTANDING: In machine learning, the concept of probability plays an important role. For example, we ask our machine learning algorithm how likely our result is. Thus, after knowing the importance I started a playlist of Prof. Joe Biltzstein from Harvard University.

**DAY 27,28:**
Naive Bayes Classifier:
This algorithm is mostly used in text classification/ Spam Filtering/ Sentiment Analysis/Recommendation System and with problems having multiple classes.Knew 3 different popular [Naive Bayes classifiers](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/naive-bayes-explained/
).

**DAY 30-34:**
[SVM](https://eduvatecom.wordpress.com/2018/09/16/large-margin-classifier-svm/) article.


**DAY 35-37:**
Linear and non Linear classification using SVM:<br/>
Based on the dataset, if it is linearly separable  LinearSVM can be used or
else  kernel trick is used to project the data into a high-dimensional space before attempting to find a hyperplane.
<br/>
Spam classification:<br/>
Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails 
into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy.SVMs are used to build own spam filter.<br/>

**DAY 43,44:**</br>
Flask is the best choice for all the web programmers, to start from the scratch and for building minimalistic web applications. One more advantage of using Flask is you can integrate machine learning algorithms(Python Based) within the functions with ease which makes your applications more intelligent and cognitive.

Here are few websites models you can build with Flask:

Blog Applications, Chat Applications, Data Visualisation, Dashboards, REST Applications, Admin Pages, Email-Services.
so I did a small Project on building a database for an art gallery

**DAY 52-57:**</br>
Pandas and Numpy</br>
Prepared and gave a seminar</br>

**DAY 58:**</br>
As before starting to learn any new technologies, knowing its use cases and real world applications helps in improved learning,i have started with knowing the amazing applications of deel learning and how ks it different from machine learning

**DAY 59-60:**</br>
Started course.fast.ai which is a top down approach of doing deep learning

**DAY 61-100:**</br>
